# Approximate Clustering for Image Segmentation Using K-Means on Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates an approximate solution to a clustering problem commonly encountered in computer vision tasks, specifically image segmentation. It uses synthetic data generated with Gaussian blobs and applies K-Means clustering to segment the image.

---

## Overview

The repository contains a Python script that:

- Generates a synthetic 2D image composed of Gaussian blobs (clusters) of points.
- Applies K-Means clustering to segment these points into clusters.
- Visualizes the segmented clusters in a 2D scatter plot.

This task approximates the challenging problem of image segmentation, which is relevant in the context of computational complexity and NP-Completeness discussions.

## Features

- Synthetic image generation with controllable cluster centers and spread.
- K-Means clustering applied to pixel data points.
- Visualization of segmented clusters with distinct colors.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation using `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`.
